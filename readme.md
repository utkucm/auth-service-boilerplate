# NodeJS Typescript Authentication Service Boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate for authentication services and boilerplate. It is first commit represents that it builded in very rush. The architecture and code will be maintained and refactored very soon. Testing will be added soon.

## Installation

You need to initialize a Postgresql database for the service. For now it only supports postgresql and uses typeorm. Then make sure you have a .env.(development, production and testing) files according to .env.example file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utkucm/auth-service-boilerplate.git
```

## Why I am building this?

I realized that I write a lot of boilerplate code for the authentication for the most of my work.
